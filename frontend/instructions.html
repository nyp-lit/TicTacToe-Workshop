      <p>1. The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</p>
      <p>2. Player 1 is "X" and Player 2 is "O".</p>
      <p>3. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.</p>
      <p>4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.</p>
      <p>5. If all 9 squares are full and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.</p>
